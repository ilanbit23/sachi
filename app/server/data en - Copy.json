        "title": "Oded, a personal story",
        "textPrimary": "How was SAHI created? It began in the frantic mind of Oded Weiss in 1999. At the time, he was experimenting with anonymous food distribution to needy families and the disabled, while raising his own family and working in a foster home for children. One day, one of the children came home from school and told him that he had learned about the value of “love thy neighbor”, and yet one hour later he went out to the playground and hit another boy. The event led Oded to the realization that as a society, we are only paying lip service in educating our children. We do not really mean what we say. Oded, who had experienced the power of anonymous giving, decided to try and recreate the successful influence of giving, and convey that feeling to children in his care. He suggested to the children at the foster home that they collect small change in a collection box. The girls baked challah bread for Shabbat, and together they started distributing food to five needy families. After a while, Oded heard from teachers at the school that students in the project were showing improved behavior and learning at school, showed greater motivation, exhibited less stress and were less disruptive in class.Oded’s conclusion was that when a child feels that he is meaningful, he is more open to learning and to accepting positive input.",
        "textSecondary": "Later, while working at the “Kedma” Youth Village, Oded engaged the youth in a discussion of families living in hunger. Their reaction was: “we need to help these families. What can we do?” and so they started to distribute food together. The activity was conducted in the middle of the night, anonymously, with food packages being laid at the families’ doorsteps and without disclosing the identity of the givers. In the intimate environment created in the car while driving from one home to another, the youth began to share deeply personal, meaningful stories and feelings from their world. The “clandestine” night activity opened a window onto the inner lives of the youth and allowed them to open up their personal world to positive adult role models.This is how the SAHI concept began to take shape: food distribution as a tool for giving, through which youth begin to feel that they are meaningful as they open their hearts to positive adults in their environment.",

        "textPrimary": "July 2009: Oded Weiss and Avraham Hayon, later to become SAHI CEO, arrive at a parking lot in a neighborhood that is “well-known to the police” in the periphery city of Kiryat Gat. They bring with them straw mats, cushions and a small metal pot (“finjan”). “We lit a small bonfire, boiled some herbal tea and waited”, say Oded and Avraham. Slowly, kids from all over the neighborhood began to appear. “We sat with them, talked with them and got to know them. The older kids brought flour and together we baked pita bread. We decided to meet again on the following Wednesday. This time, the kids were already waiting for us. Some of them brought friends along, and the group began to grow week by week”. True to their pro-active attitude, while talking to the kids around the bonfire, Oded and Avraham employed “planned spontaneity” to raise the issue of giving to the needy, and – bingo! It turned out that the youth in the neighborhood knew better than anyone else who among their neighbors had the greatest needs. ",
        "textSecondary": "From assisting one family once a week, the project grew to encompass hundreds of families throughout the country. The neighborhood kids, the same ones who were well known to the police, are today busy identifying needs and finding solutions; they are aware of needy families in their environment and are looking for ways to help them. The youth that used to destroy the neighborhood are now building it with their own hands!"

        "textPrimary": "The Units: today, SAHI (the Hebrew acronym for Special Grace Unit) operates tens of groups around the country. The focus of activity is in the center, in Jerusalem and in the southern region. The Grace Units are comprised of girls and boys aged 13 to 18. The members of the Unit meet once a week to collect food and once a week to distribute it, thus contributing two days out of their week to giving to someone else. Among their activities, the group “chiefs” find the time to create meaningful meetings in which they talk with the youth about the meaning of giving and its influence on their personal world and on the community. ",
        "textSecondary": "Collection day: a small group from the Unit goes to supermarkets in order to collect food for needy families. Some of them will stand at the entrance to the supermarket and will tell shoppers about SAHI’s activities, asking them to donate one product on their way out. Others will wait by the exit from the supermarket, asking shoppers whether they could contribute food for the needy. It is important to note that the youth never ask for money, only for food. Every shopper who gives a product is greeted with cries of thanks and good wishes from the youth.  Distribution Day: members of the Unit arrive at their meeting point, where they organize the food products into boxes according to the number of recipient families in the neighborhood. They then go out on their distribution routes in teams of four, each team comprising an adult volunteer who comes with a car in order to help carry the food packages. The distribution method is through “anonymous giving”, designed to safeguard the honor of the recipient family and to convey to the youth the value of giving with modesty. Unique Grace Operations: in addition to the regular weekly SAHI activities, the Units carry out unique grace operations throughout the year, such as visits to elderly homes on regular days and around the holidays; water distribution on hot summer days and soup distribution on cold winter days to passers-by on the sidewalk; visits to Holocaust survivors in their homes for heart-to-heart talks; house refurbishment and repairs for needy tenants; and creation of accessibility ramps for the handicapped in the neighborhood. With time, the Grace Units become neighborhood emergency units, helping for example the Jerusalem Municipality when there were heavy snowstorms in the city. Unit members help neighborhood administrators with distribution of food, heaters and blankets during emergencies. In addition, they have also rescued numerous elderly people from their snow-blocked homes and have cleared frozen paths. ",
